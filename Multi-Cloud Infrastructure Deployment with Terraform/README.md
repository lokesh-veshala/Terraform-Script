# Project Overview

The **Multi-Cloud Infrastructure Deployment with Terraform** project aims to streamline the process of provisioning infrastructure resources across multiple cloud environments using Terraform.

## Problem Statement

In modern cloud-centric environments, organizations often deploy their applications across multiple cloud providers to leverage diverse services and ensure redundancy. However, managing infrastructure across different clouds can be complex and time-consuming, requiring separate configurations and deployment processes for each provider.

## Solution

This project offers a unified solution for deploying infrastructure resources on both AWS and VMWare environments using Terraform. By intelligently detecting the environment and dynamically provisioning resources, the script simplifies the deployment process and ensures consistency across different clouds.

## Key Components

- **Automated Provider Detection**: The script automatically detects the cloud provider environment (AWS or VMWare) based on user-defined configurations or environmental variables.
- **Dynamic Resource Provisioning**: Leveraging Terraform's flexibility, the script dynamically creates instances, volumes, and networks tailored to the selected environment.
- **Customization Options**: Users can customize instance types, volume sizes, and other parameters to suit their specific requirements.

## Benefits

- **Simplified Deployment**: With a single Terraform script, users can provision infrastructure resources across multiple cloud environments, eliminating the need for separate configuration files and deployment procedures.
- **Consistency and Scalability**: The project promotes consistency in infrastructure configurations and deployment processes, facilitating scalability and reducing operational overhead.
- **Time and Cost Savings**: By automating the deployment process, organizations can save time and resources, enabling faster application delivery and innovation.

## Future Enhancements

- **Support for Additional Cloud Providers**: Expand the project to support other cloud providers such as Azure, Google Cloud Platform, or OpenStack.
- **Enhanced Customization**: Introduce more customization options for advanced users, such as network configurations, security settings, and tagging strategies.
- **Integration with CI/CD Pipelines**: Integrate the Terraform script into CI/CD pipelines for automated testing, validation, and deployment of infrastructure changes.

## Prerequisites

- Terraform installed on your local machine. You can download it [here](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html).
- Access to AWS and/or VMWare environments with appropriate credentials.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lokesh-veshala/Terraform-Script

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd Terraform-Script/Multi-Cloud Infrastructure Deployment with Terraform

 Update the provider variable in the terraform.tfvars file to specify the desired environment (aws or vmware).

3. Initialize Terraform:
```bash
terraform init

4. Review the execution plan:
```bash
terraform plan

5. Apply the changes:
```bash
terraform apply

Confirm the changes when prompted.
